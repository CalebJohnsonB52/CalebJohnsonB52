- 👋 Hi, I’m Caleb Johnson
- 👀 I’m interested in Java Script, Python, ultimate frisbee, volleyball and anything that has to do with computer technology and electrical engineering. I also have a strong interest in computer security and blue team tactics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Java Script. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects around Java Script but also open to anything that will give me an opprotunity to expand my skills.

_ Hi, I’m Caleb Johnson
_ I’m interested in Java Script, Python, C, and anything that has to do with computer technology and electrical engineering. I also have a strong interest in computer security and blue team tactics. 
_ I’m currently learning Python and JavaScript. 
_ I’m looking to collaborate on projects around Java Script but am also open to anything that will give me an opportunity to expand my skills. 
_ You can reach out to me with questions at basher5two@gmail.com. Thank you and I wish you the best.
